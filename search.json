We compared ECMWF SEAS5 and INSIVUMEH (CFSv2, CCSM4, CESM1) seasonal precipitation forecasts using 25 years (2000–2024) of hindcasts validated against three independent observation sources (ERA5, ENACTS, CHIRPS). For Primera (May–August), SEAS5 is recommended based on consistently stronger performance across both binary and continuous skill metrics (F1, ROC-AUC, Spearman correlation), with ROC-AUC values of 0.85–0.90 at 1–2 month lead times that remain robust across all observation sources. For Postrera (September–November), INSIVUMEH forecasts are eliminated due to weak internal consistency: near-zero inter-leadtime correlations (r = -0.1 to 0.2) and coefficient of variation 3–7× lower than observations indicate negligible predictive signal. Initial SEAS5 Postrera analysis using the 2000-2024 baseline also showed limited skill. However, expanding the analysis to Honduras and El Salvador (which rely solely on SEAS5) and extending the baseline to 1981-2024 revealed substantially stronger Postrera skill: ROC-AUC of 0.80-0.87 at LT0 and 0.72-0.79 at LT1. We recommend SEAS5 for both seasons, with Postrera forecasts using LT0-1 and the 1981-2024 baseline for threshold calculation.",

    "section": "1.2 Research Progression",
    "text": "1.2 Research Progression\n\n1.2.1 Step 1: Start with Standard Metrics\nThe analysis began with binary classification metrics (Chapter 1) - the traditional approach where forecasts are scored as hits or misses against a drought threshold (return period of 4 years).\nPrimera results were encouraging: SEAS5 showed F1 scores around 50-60%, significantly better than random guessing. Several model-leadtime combinations beat the 90th percentile of bootstrap random simulations.\nPostrera was troubling: No model showed statistically significant skill. F1 scores hovered near random guessing levels. Different models won at different leadtimes with no clear pattern.\nRemaining question: Are the Postrera results genuinely inconclusive, or are binary metrics too noisy with only ~6 drought events in 25 years?\n\n\n1.2.2 Step 2: Try Continuous Metrics\nChapter 2 introduced continuous metrics that don’t require threshold choices: Spearman correlation, RMSE, and ROC-AUC. These provide partial credit for near-misses and are more stable with small samples.\nPrimera confirmation: SEAS5 dominated across all continuous metrics. AUC values around 0.88 - meaning 88% probability of correctly ranking a drought year below a non-drought year. The signal was real.\nPostrera remained ambiguous: Different metrics favored different models:\n\nSpearman: SEAS5 best at LT1\nRMSE: CCSM4 best\nAUC: SEAS5 at LT1, CCSM4 at LT2\n\nNo model showed AUC consistently above 0.7 (general threshold for “acceptable” discrimination skill).\nRemaining question: Are these results sensitive to which observation dataset we validate against? Would a different “ground truth” give the same answer?\n\n\n1.2.3 Step 3: Bring in a Third Opinion\nChapter 3 introduced CHIRPS as an independent observation source alongside ERA5 and ENACTS. If forecasts perform well against multiple observation sources, the skill assessment is more credible.\nPrimera verdict: Skill was robust across all three observation sources. SEAS5 won most comparisons.\nPostrera raised a red flag: CCSM4 showed better skill at longer leadtimes (LT2-3) than shorter ones (LT1). This is backwards - forecast skill should degrade with increasing leadtime, not improve. The pattern suggested we might be seeing noise rather than genuine skill.\nRemaining question: What’s causing the inverted skill-leadtime relationship for Postrera?\n\n\n1.2.4 Step 4: Check for Drift\nChapter 4 investigated whether temporal trends in forecasts or observations could explain the strange patterns.\nFindings:\n\nENACTS showed a drying trend for Primera, but other sources showed similar patterns\nForecast error drift was modest (~5-8 mm/year)\nSplit-half stability was the key finding: Primera correlations were stable between 2000-2012 and 2013-2024, but Postrera correlations were wildly different between periods\n\nThe drift analysis didn’t explain the inverted skill pattern.\n\n\n1.2.5 Step 5: The Decider - Forecast Internal Consistency\nChapter 5 applied internal consistency diagnostics - asking not “do forecasts predict observations?” but “do forecasts behave like forecasts?”\nInter-leadtime correlations: For a well-behaved forecast, LT1 and LT2 predictions for the same target season should correlate - they’re trying to predict the same thing.\n\nSEAS5: LT1-LT2 correlations of 0.6-0.9 (expected)\nINSIVUMEH Primera: Moderate correlations of 0.3-0.7 (acceptable)\nINSIVUMEH Postrera: Near-zero or negative correlations - when LT1 predicts wet, LT2 might predict dry for the same season\n\nCoefficient of Variation (CV): Forecasts should show interannual variability approaching observed variability.\n\nObserved Postrera CV: ~23%\nSEAS5 Postrera CV: ~15% (reasonable)\nINSIVUMEH Postrera CV: 3-7% - forecasts barely varied from climatology\n\nThis eliminated INSIVUMEH from consideration for Postrera - their forecasts lack predictive signal. But SEAS5 Postrera skill also appeared limited. This raised a concern: Honduras and El Salvador rely solely on SEAS5 without a national forecast alternative.\n\n\n1.2.6 Step 6: ENSO Stratification\nChapter 6 examined whether forecast skill varies by ENSO phase. The key finding: Primera skill is consistent across ENSO phases, but Postrera El Niño years remain challenging for all models.\n\n\n1.2.7 Step 7: The Breakthrough - Regional Comparison & Baseline Extension\nThe poor Postrera skill had implications beyond Guatemala. Honduras and El Salvador use SEAS5 for their anticipatory action frameworks—if SEAS5 Postrera lacks skill, these frameworks are affected too.\nChapter 7 expanded the analysis across the Dry Corridor (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador) and tested different baseline periods. This revealed a breakthrough finding:\nThe 2000-2024 baseline was masking Postrera skill.\nExtending to 1981-2024 (44 years) dramatically improved apparent Postrera skill:\n\n\n\nLeadtime\nROC-AUC (2000-2024)\nROC-AUC (1981-2024)\n\n\n\n\nLT0\n0.66-0.81\n0.80-0.87\n\n\nLT1\n0.55-0.79\n0.72-0.79\n\n\nLT2\n0.48-0.62\n0.63-0.77\n\n\n\nThe longer baseline provides more stable threshold estimates and reveals skill that was obscured by the shorter record.",

    "text": "3.1 Beyond Binary: A More Nuanced View\nThe binary metrics in Chapter 2 (F1 score, precision, recall) provide one lens on forecast skill, but they can be noisy - especially with only ~25 years of data and ~6 drought events. A single misclassified year can swing F1 scores dramatically.\nConsider an analogy: judging a temperature forecast as “wrong” for predicting 33°F when it was actually 31°F. The forecast told you to expect cold, even if it missed the freezing threshold. Binary metrics don’t distinguish between a near-miss and being completely off.\nThis chapter introduces continuous metrics that provide a more nuanced picture:\nOf these, ROC-AUC is particularly interpretable for operational decisions. An AUC of 0.75 means: “If you randomly select a drought year and a non-drought year, there’s a 75% chance the forecast correctly identifies which is drier.” This directly answers whether the forecast can discriminate drought from non-drought conditions - the core operational question.\nSetup: Libraries and data loading\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(cumulus)\nlibrary(yardstick)\nlibrary(gghdx)\ngghdx()\n\nbox::use(../../R/enacts)\nbox::use(../../R/seas5)\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# Configuration\nBASELINE_START &lt;- 2000\nBASELINE_END &lt;- 2024\nPRIMERA_MONTHS &lt;- 5:8\nPOSTRERA_MONTHS &lt;- 9:11\nPRIMERA_ISSUED_MONTHS &lt;- c(3, 4, 5)\nPOSTRERA_ISSUED_MONTHS &lt;- c(6, 7, 8, 9)\n\n# Helper function\ncalc_rp_threshold &lt;- function(x, rp_target = 4, direction = -1) {\n  x &lt;- x[!is.na(x)]\n  n &lt;- length(x)\n  if (n &lt; 3) return(NA_real_)\n  ranks &lt;- rank(x * -direction, ties.method = \"average\")\n  rp &lt;- (n + 1) / ranks\n  approx(rp, x, xout = rp_target, rule = 2)$y\n}\nLoad forecast and observation data\n# Load forecasts\ndf_insiv &lt;- cumulus::blob_read(\n  name = \"ds-aa-lac-dry-corridor/data/processed/insivumeh_special/insivumeh_special_models_zonal_seasonal_chiquimula.parquet\",\n  container = \"projects\"\n)\ndf_enacts &lt;- enacts$load_enacts_seasonal(\"chiquimula\")\ndf_seas5 &lt;- seas5$load_seas5_seasonal()\n\n# Load ERA5\ncon &lt;- pg_con()\ndf_era5_raw &lt;- tbl(con, \"era5\") |&gt;\n  filter(pcode == \"GT20\") |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    year = year(valid_date),\n    month = month(valid_date),\n    mean = mean * days_in_month(valid_date)\n  )\nDBI::dbDisconnect(con)\n\n# Aggregate ERA5 to seasonal\naggregate_obs_seasonal &lt;- function(df, window_name) {\n  months &lt;- if (window_name == \"primera\") PRIMERA_MONTHS else POSTRERA_MONTHS\n  df |&gt;\n    filter(month %in% months) |&gt;\n    group_by(year) |&gt;\n    summarise(obs_mm = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n    mutate(window = window_name)\n}\n\ndf_era5 &lt;- bind_rows(\n  aggregate_obs_seasonal(df_era5_raw |&gt; rename(value = mean), \"primera\"),\n  aggregate_obs_seasonal(df_era5_raw |&gt; rename(value = mean), \"postrera\")\n)\n\n# Combine forecasts\ndf_fcst_all &lt;- bind_rows(df_insiv, df_seas5) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= BASELINE_START, year &lt;= BASELINE_END)\n\n# Filter to operational leadtimes\ndf_fcst_filtered &lt;- df_fcst_all |&gt;\n  mutate(issued_month = month(issued_date)) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    (window == \"primera\" & issued_month %in% PRIMERA_ISSUED_MONTHS) |\n    (window == \"postrera\" & issued_month %in% POSTRERA_ISSUED_MONTHS)\n  )",

SEAS5 is the clear winner with AUC values around 0.80 - meaning 80% probability of correctly ranking a drought vs non-drought year.\nPostrera remains challenging - no model shows consistent, strong skill. AUC values hover near 0.5-0.6 (barely above random guessing). Consider supplementing with monitoring-based triggers.\nROC-AUC provides the clearest picture - it directly answers “can this forecast discriminate drought?” without depending on threshold choices. Binary F1 scores can be variable with small samples; AUC is more stable.\nBias matters operationally - INSIVUMEH models systematically over-predict Primera rainfall by ~250mm. This could be corrected with simple bias adjustment if these models are used.\nCorrelation and AUC tell consistent stories - both favor SEAS5 for Primera, show weaker skill for Postrera. When multiple metrics agree, we can be more confident in the assessment.\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Operational Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason\nRecommended Model\nConfidence\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nPrimera LT0\nSEAS5\nHigh\nOnly option for May activation\n\n\nPrimera LT1-2\nSEAS5\nHigh\nBest on all metrics\n\n\nPostrera LT1-2\nCCSM4 or SEAS5\nLow\nConsider ensemble or monitoring triggers",

    "text": "4.3 Metrics Against CHIRPS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy Rank-Based Metrics Work Across Different Observation Sources\n\n\n\nBecause CHIRPS and ENACTS have different climatologies (CHIRPS shows ~300mm higher Primera totals), comparing raw mm errors across sources would be misleading. Instead, we focus on rank-based metrics:\n\nSpearman correlation: Evaluates the full ranking across all years. If observations rank years as [driest, 2nd, 3rd, … wettest], how well does the forecast reproduce that ordering? Larger rank errors are penalized more heavily.\nROC-AUC: Evaluates separation between drought and non-drought years only. Do drought years consistently get lower forecasts than non-drought years? It ignores ranking within each group—scrambling the order of non-drought years doesn’t affect AUC.\n\nWhen they diverge: A forecast could perfectly separate drought from non-drought (AUC=1) but scramble rankings within each group (moderate Spearman). Or it could track the overall wet-dry gradient well (high Spearman) but fail to place drought years at the bottom (low AUC).\nThese metrics allow fair comparison of forecast skill across observation sources with different absolute values.\n\n\nSpearman & ROC-AUC continue to tell a similar story. Models are skillful in primera with SEAS5 as the dominant competitor. Postrera skill remains low, dubious, and messy. Different models win at different leadtimes with some surprising results of INSIVUMEH provided models showing stronger predictive power at greater leadtimes. SEAS5 remains competitive, but less dominant\n\n\nCalculate thresholds and metrics\n# Forecast thresholds\ndf_fcst_thresh &lt;- df_joined |&gt;\n  group_by(forecast_source, window, leadtime) |&gt;\n  summarise(fcst_thresh = calc_rp_threshold(value), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# CHIRPS observation thresholds\ndf_obs_thresh &lt;- df_chirps |&gt;\n  group_by(window) |&gt;\n  summarise(obs_thresh = calc_rp_threshold(obs_mm), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Join thresholds\ndf_analysis &lt;- df_joined |&gt;\n  left_join(df_fcst_thresh, by = c(\"forecast_source\", \"window\", \"leadtime\")) |&gt;\n  left_join(df_obs_thresh, by = \"window\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    fcst_drought = value &lt; fcst_thresh,\n    obs_drought = obs_mm &lt; obs_thresh\n  )\n\n# Continuous metrics\ndf_metrics &lt;- df_analysis |&gt;\n  group_by(forecast_source, window, leadtime) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    spearman = cor(value, obs_mm, method = \"spearman\", use = \"complete.obs\"),\n    bias_mm = mean(value - obs_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt; \n     mutate(\n      window = fct_relevel(window, \"primera\", \"postrera\")\n    )\n\n\n# vectorized calc AUC\ncalc_auc &lt;- function(truth, drought_score) {                                                                                                                                           \n  if (length(unique(truth)) &lt; 2) return(NA_real_)                                                                                                                           \n  roc_auc_vec(truth, drought_score, event_level = \"first\")                                                                                                                            \n}                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\ndf_roc &lt;- df_analysis |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    truth = factor(\n      obs_drought,\n      levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n      labels = c(\"drought\", \"no_drought\")\n      ),\n    # roc_auc is just rank based, magnitude doesnt matter just invert to +drought +score\n    drought_score = -value\n  )\n\ndf_auc &lt;- df_roc |&gt;                                                                                 \n  group_by(forecast_source, window, leadtime) |&gt;                                                                                                                                      \n  summarise(auc = calc_auc(truth, drought_score), .groups = \"drop\")   \n\n\n\n4.3.1 Spearman Correlation\n\n\nCode\ncreate_metric_heatmap &lt;- function(df, metric_col, metric_name, title, caption, midpoint = 0) {\n  df_plot &lt;- df |&gt;\n    group_by(window, leadtime) |&gt;\n    mutate(is_best = !!sym(metric_col) == max(!!sym(metric_col), na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n    ungroup() \n \n\n  ggplot(df_plot, aes(x = factor(leadtime), y = forecast_source)) +\n    geom_tile(aes(fill = !!sym(metric_col)), color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n    geom_tile(\n      data = df_plot |&gt; filter(is_best),\n      fill = NA, color = \"black\", linewidth = 1.5\n    ) +\n    geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f\", !!sym(metric_col))), size = 4, fontface = \"bold\", color = \"black\") +\n    facet_wrap(~window) +\n    scale_fill_gradient2(\n      low = \"#D73027\", mid = \"#FFFFBF\", high = \"#1A9850\",\n      midpoint = midpoint, name = metric_name\n    ) +\n    labs(title = title, x = \"Leadtime (months)\", y = NULL, caption = caption) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"right\", panel.grid = element_blank(),\n          plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))\n}\n\ncreate_metric_heatmap(\n  df = df_metrics,\n  metric_col = \"spearman\",\n  metric_name =\"Spearman ρ\",\n  title = \"Spearman Correlation - CHIRPS\",\n  caption = \"All forecasts validated against CHIRPS.

    "text": "4.4 Conclusions\n\n4.4.1 What We’ve Learned So Far\n\nPrimera skill is robust: Multiple models show genuine skill (AUC &gt; 0.7) across all three observation sources. This isn’t an artifact of one particular dataset.\nPostrera remains unresolved: No model shows reliable, consistent skill. CCSM4’s apparent better performance at longer leadtimes is suspicious - skill should not improve with leadtime. This inverted pattern is likely noise from the small sample (only ~6 drought events in 25 years).\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Open Questions\nThe tie-breaker analysis raises more questions than it answers for Postrera:\n\nWhy the inverted skill pattern? CCSM4 showing better skill at LT2-3 than LT1 is backwards - forecast skill should degrade with leadtime. Is this genuine or noise?\nWhich model is actually better? With different metrics favoring different models at different leadtimes, we cannot make a confident recommendation.\nIs the poor skill a data artifact? Could temporal trends in the observation sources be affecting our skill estimates?\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Next Steps\nTo better understand the poor Postrera skill and the contradictory patterns across models, the next chapter examines temporal drift - whether systematic trends in forecasts or observations might explain some of what we’re seeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTechnical Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.4 CHIRPS vs ENACTS Comparison\nHow different are CHIRPS and ENACTS for Chiquimula? Understanding this helps interpret why forecast skill might differ across observation sources.\n\n\nCompare CHIRPS and ENACTS observations\n# Load ENACTS for comparison\ndf_enacts_compare &lt;- enacts$load_enacts_seasonal(\"chiquimula\")\n\ndf_compare &lt;- df_chirps |&gt;\n  rename(chirps = obs_mm) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    df_enacts_compare |&gt; select(year, window, enacts = obs_mm),\n    by = c(\"year\", \"window\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(enacts))\n\n# Correlation\ncorr_primera &lt;- df_compare |&gt; filter(window == \"primera\") |&gt;\n  summarise(r = cor(chirps, enacts)) |&gt; pull(r)\ncorr_postrera &lt;- df_compare |&gt; filter(window == \"postrera\") |&gt;\n  summarise(r = cor(chirps, enacts)) |&gt; pull(r)\n\ndf_compare |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = enacts, y = chirps)) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey50\") +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"#007CE1\", fill = \"#007CE1\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~str_to_title(window), scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"CHIRPS vs ENACTS: Same Region, Different Estimates\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\"Primera r = %.2f, Postrera r = %.2f\", corr_primera, corr_postrera),\n    x = \"ENACTS (mm)\",\n    y = \"CHIRPS (mm)\",\n    caption = \"Dashed line = 1:1 agreement. CHIRPS consistently higher for Primera.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHIRPS and ENACTS are correlated but not identical. CHIRPS tends to estimate higher rainfall for Primera (~300mm more on average). This means a forecast calibrated to one source may not match the other perfectly - making the three-source comparison a meaningful robustness check.\n\n\n4.4.5 Forecast Bias\nBias (mean forecast - observed) is shown for completeness, but is not consequential for our framework since we use rank-based metrics and model-specific thresholds rather than raw precipitation values.\n\n\nCode\ndf_plot &lt;- df_metrics |&gt;\n  group_by(window, leadtime) |&gt;\n  mutate(is_best = abs(bias_mm) == min(abs(bias_mm), na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nbias_max &lt;- max(abs(df_plot$bias_mm), na.rm = TRUE)\n\nggplot(df_plot, aes(x = factor(leadtime), y = forecast_source)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = bias_mm), color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_tile(\n    data = df_plot |&gt; filter(is_best),\n    fill = NA, color = \"black\", linewidth = 1.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.0f\", bias_mm)), size = 4, fontface = \"bold\", color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~window) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"#D73027\", mid = \"#FFFFBF\", high = \"#1A9850\",\n    midpoint = 0, limits = c(-bias_max, bias_max), name = \"Bias (mm)\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Forecast Bias - CHIRPS\",\n    x = \"Leadtime (months)\", y = NULL,\n    caption = \"Units: millimeters.

SEAS5 has the largest dry bias for Primera (~280mm under), while INSIVUMEH models are closer (~120mm under).",

    "text": "5.6 Summary\n\n5.6.1 What We Found\nTemporal drift in climate data products is a known issue across many sources and regions - satellite algorithms evolve, station networks change, and reanalysis systems are updated. We observe drift here as well:\n\nObservations: ENACTS shows a stronger drying trend for Primera than other sources\nForecasts: Some significant trends exist (e.g., SEAS5 Primera drying ~4 mm/yr)\nError drift: INSIVUMEH Primera errors are trending positive, accumulating ~150-200mm over 24 years\nSplit-half stability: Postrera correlations are highly unstable between early and late periods\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Does This Explain Poor Postrera Skill?\nNo. The drift magnitudes are modest relative to interannual variability, and drift affects both seasons similarly. The split-half instability for Postrera is concerning, but this is more likely a symptom of limited sample size than evidence that drift is causing poor skill.\nBottom line: Drift is present but does not explain the contradictory Postrera patterns from Chapter 3. The investigation continues in the next chapter with internal consistency diagnostics.",

    "text": "7.9 Tolerant F1: Accounting for Near-Miss Events\nStandard F1 score uses a strict binary classification: both the forecast and observation must cross the exact same RP4 threshold for a True Positive. This is harsh because forecasting drought when a “pretty dry” year occurred (e.g., RP3.5) receives zero credit.\nThe problem with strict F1:\nConsider a year where:\n\nForecast: drought (below RP4 threshold)\nObservation: RP3.5 (dry, but just above RP4 threshold)\n\nUnder strict rules, this is a False Positive. But operationally, this forecast was useful - it correctly identified a dry year.\nAsymmetric tolerance approach:\nWe define three observation categories:\n\nSevere drought: obs ≤ RP4 threshold (~25% of years)\nMarginal: RP4 &lt; obs ≤ RP3 (~8% of years, the “buffer zone”)\nNormal: obs &gt; RP3 (~67% of years)\n\nThe asymmetric rules:\n\nTP: Forecast drought AND observation is severe OR marginal (give credit for “close enough”)\nFP: Forecast drought AND observation is normal (only penalize if clearly not drought)\nFN: No forecast AND observation is severe (only penalize misses of clear droughts)\nTN: No forecast AND observation is marginal OR normal\n\nThis approach treats marginal years favorably in both directions: forecast drought gets credit, no-forecast isn’t penalized.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate thresholds for both RP levels\ncalc_rp_threshold &lt;- function(x, rp_target = 4, direction = -1) {\n  x &lt;- x[!is.na(x)]\n  n &lt;- length(x)\n  if (n &lt;

    "text": "7.10 Combined Annual Return Period\nWhen using multiple leadtimes and both seasons, the effective annual trigger frequency is higher than the per-forecast RP4 threshold suggests. If any forecast in any season crosses the RP4 threshold, you trigger - and with multiple “chances” per year, triggers become more frequent.\nThe math: If each forecast has independent 25% trigger probability (RP4), the probability of triggering at least once across N forecasts is:\n\\[P(\\text{at least one trigger}) = 1 - (1 - 0.25)^N\\]\nWith 3 Primera leadtimes (LT0-2) and 2 Postrera leadtimes (LT0-1), that’s 5 forecasts per year, giving a theoretical combined RP of ~1.8 years if forecasts were independent.

This is by design - multiple monitoring windows provide redundancy and earlier warning, but the cost is more frequent activations.\n\n7.10.1 Threshold Tuning for Target Combined RP\nIf a specific combined annual RP is desired (e.g., RP3 or RP4 annually), we can adjust the per-season thresholds. The heatmap below shows how different Primera and Postrera RP thresholds combine to produce a total annual RP.\n\n\nCode\n# Grid of RP thresholds to test\nrp_grid &lt;- seq(3, 8, by = 0.25)\n\n# Function to calculate combined annual RP for given thresholds\ncalc_combined_rp &lt;- function(df, primera_rp, postrera_rp, primera_lts = 0:2, postrera_lts = 0:1) {\n\n # Calculate thresholds for each RP level\n  primera_thresh &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(window == \"primera\", leadtime %in% primera_lts) |&gt;\n    group_by(country_aoi, leadtime) |&gt;\n    summarise(fcst_thresh = calc_rp_threshold(fcst_mm, primera_rp, -1), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n  postrera_thresh &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(window == \"postrera\", leadtime %in% postrera_lts) |&gt;\n    group_by(country_aoi, leadtime) |&gt;\n    summarise(fcst_thresh = calc_rp_threshold(fcst_mm, postrera_rp, -1), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n  # Check triggers\n  primera_triggers &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(window == \"primera\", leadtime %in% primera_lts) |&gt;\n    left_join(primera_thresh, by = c(\"country_aoi\", \"leadtime\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(triggered = fcst_mm &lt;= fcst_thresh) |&gt;\n    group_by(country_aoi, year) |&gt;\n    summarise(primera_triggered = any(triggered), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n  postrera_triggers &lt;- df |&gt;\n    filter(window == \"postrera\", leadtime %in% postrera_lts) |&gt;\n    left_join(postrera_thresh, by = c(\"country_aoi\", \"leadtime\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(triggered = fcst_mm &lt;= fcst_thresh) |&gt;\n    group_by(country_aoi, year) |&gt;\n    summarise(postrera_triggered = any(triggered), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n  # Combine and calculate annual RP\n  primera_triggers |&gt;\n    left_join(postrera_triggers, by = c(\"country_aoi\", \"year\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(annual_triggered = primera_triggered | postrera_triggered) |&gt;\n    group_by(country_aoi) |&gt;\n    summarise(\n      trigger_rate = mean(annual_triggered, na.rm = TRUE),\n      combined_rp = 1 / trigger_rate,\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n}\n\n# Calculate for all combinations\ndf_baseline &lt;- df_joined |&gt; filter(year &gt;= 1981, year &lt;= 2024)\n\ndf_rp_grid &lt;- expand_grid(\n  primera_rp = rp_grid,\n  postrera_rp = rp_grid\n) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    results = map2(primera_rp, postrera_rp, ~calc_combined_rp(df_baseline, .x, .y))\n  ) |&gt;\n  unnest(results)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use coarser grid with text labels for readability\ndf_rp_coarse &lt;- df_rp_grid |&gt;\n  filter(primera_rp %in% seq(3, 8, by = 0.5), postrera_rp %in% seq(3, 8, by = 0.5)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    country_aoi = factor(country_aoi, levels = c(\"Guatemala\", \"Honduras\", \"El Salvador\")),\n    rp_label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", combined_rp),\n    is_rp4 = primera_rp == 4 & postrera_rp == 4\n  )\n\ndf_rp_coarse |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = factor(primera_rp), y = factor(postrera_rp), fill = combined_rp)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.3) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = rp_label, color = combined_rp &gt; 3), size = 2.5) +\n  geom_tile(data = . %&gt;% filter(is_rp4), fill = NA, color = \"red\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~country_aoi) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(\n    name = \"Combined\\nAnnual RP\",\n    palette = \"RdYlGn\",\n    direction = 1,\n    limits = c(1.5, 5),\n    oob = scales::squish\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"black\", \"FALSE\" = \"white\"), guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Combined Annual RP by Primera × Postrera Threshold\",\n    subtitle = \"Red box = current RP4/RP4 setting.

    "text": "9.1 Overview\n?sec-honduras-trigger developed a purely rainfall-based trigger optimization for Honduras, defining drought as the N driest ERA5 years (matched return period). This chapter takes a different approach: we begin with humanitarian impact data to identify which years must be triggered, then layer in ERA5 rainfall skill to select the final configuration.\nThe key insight motivating this approach is that seasonal rainfall forecasts are an imperfect proxy for drought impact. EM-DAT records and CERF allocations provide direct evidence of when humanitarian consequences occurred. Rather than optimizing solely against observed rainfall, we first ensure our trigger catches the most consequential events, then optimize for rainfall prediction accuracy among configurations that meet that constraint.\nThis chapter covers Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. For Guatemala, we evaluate two separate areas of interest: the standard OCHA AOI (Chiquimula and Alta Verapaz) and the StartNetwork AOI (Quiché and Baja Verapaz).",

    "text": "9.2 Impact Data Landscape\nBefore defining trigger thresholds, we examine the historical record of drought impacts across the dry corridor. From this evidence we define two priority classes for the trigger optimization:\n\nPriority 1 (must-hit): The CERF hypothesis years — 2009, 2014, 2015, 2018. These are the years where CERF actually allocated drought funding (adjusted for delayed response timing). They represent donor-validated humanitarian crises where we have the strongest obligation to trigger.\nPriority 2 (should-hit): Years where all 3 countries appear in EM-DAT expanded drought records but are not CERF hypothesis years — 1994, 2001, 2019. Regional consensus across all three countries indicates widespread drought conditions, even without CERF activation.\n\nTable 9.1 shows the full landscape of CERF allocations, EM-DAT entries (both as-reported and expanded across multi-year events), and the resulting priority classification for 1991–2024.\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Impact data summary across CERF, EM-DAT, and CERF hypothesis years.

tables demonstrate a recurring pattern: some of the most impactful drought years (e.g. those with CERF allocations or high total affected) do not always coincide with the driest rainfall years, and vice versa. This imperfect correlation between rainfall and impact is the primary motivation for our hybrid optimization approach.",

    "text": "9.4 Optimization Strategy\nGiven that rainfall is an imperfect predictor of humanitarian impact, we adopt a staged optimization that prioritizes impact evidence first, then maximizes rainfall prediction skill:\n\nImpact-first filtering: Evaluate all threshold configurations against EM-DAT impact years using standard F1. Keep only configs that trigger in all Priority 1 years (must-hit). Among those, keep configs with the maximum Priority 2 hits (should-hit).\nERA5 rainfall evaluation: For the surviving candidate pool, evaluate against ERA5 observed rainfall using the tolerant matched-RP F1 from ?sec-honduras-trigger. This tells us how well each config predicts actual rainfall anomalies, independent of the impact definition.\nCombined selection: Plot impact F1 against ERA5 tolerant F1 to visualize the tradeoff. Compute an average of both F1 scores and identify the best-performing config at each return period level. Among tied configs, select the one with the lowest threshold coefficient of variation (most operationally uniform thresholds).\n\nThe rationale is straightforward: since SEAS5 forecasts are our only trigger variable, and they predict rainfall rather than impact directly, it makes sense to first ensure we capture the most consequential events (via impact filtering), then optimize for what the forecast actually predicts well (rainfall). After the priority-hit filters are satisfied, a high ERA5 tolerant F1 indicates the trigger is selecting genuinely dry years rather than succeeding on impact years by coincidence.",

EM-DAT records 17 impact years in 1991–2024, giving an empirical impact RP of 2.1 years.\nImpact Evaluation & Priority Filtering\nAfter generating 8,526 constrained configurations and evaluating against impact years, priority filtering retains 2,613 candidates that hit 100% of Priority 1 years and 67% of Priority 2 years.\nERA5 Evaluation & Combined Scoring\nThe plot below shows each candidate configuration positioned by its ERA5 tolerant F1 (x-axis) and impact F1 (y-axis). Configurations near the top-right corner perform well on both metrics. Circled points mark selected options per RP level: A = best average F1, B = best ERA5 tolerant F1. Yellow halos mark fully uniform configs (all thresholds equal across all leadtimes and seasons) — an operationally favourable baseline that simplifies trigger communication. Uniform configs are drawn from the pre-filter pool (before must-hit/should-hit filtering) so stricter options that wouldn’t pass priority filters are still visible as reference points.

    "section": "9.6 Recommended Configurations",
    "text": "9.6 Recommended Configurations\nBased on the tradeoff analysis above, we recommend the following trigger configurations:\nHonduras: RP 2.9 A (max ERA5 tol F1)\n\nPrimera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 4.4, LT2 = 4.4\nPostrera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 11.7, LT1 = 11.7, LT2 = 11.7\nSeasonal RPs: primera = 3.2, postrera = 7.0, annual = 2.9\nImpact F1 = 0.422 | ERA5 tolerant F1 = 0.633 | Avg F1 = 0.527 | CV = 0.000\n\nHonduras has 17 EM-DAT impact years in 1991–2024 — a relatively high event frequency. With this many impact years, the impact F1 scores are tightly clustered among candidate configurations at a given RP, so impact F1 alone does not discriminate well between options. Selecting the max ERA5 tolerant F1 option ensures the trigger is aligned with actual rainfall anomalies, choosing the configuration that best predicts genuinely dry years rather than succeeding on the impact metric by coincidence.\nIt is worth noting that RP 2.7 A (both) is a strong alternative. At a lower annual RP of 2.7, this configuration picks up 2012 — a year missed by the RP 2.9 options — with an avg F1 of 0.622 and ERA5 tolerant F1 of 0.679. However, this RP may fall below the target annual return period constraint, implying a higher trigger frequency than operationally desired.\n\nPrimera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 5.8, LT2 = 7.0\nPostrera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 5.8, LT2 = 7.0\nSeasonal RPs: primera = 3.5, postrera = 3.9, annual = 2.7\nImpact F1 = 0.566 | ERA5 tolerant F1 = 0.679 | Avg F1 = 0.622 | CV = 0.229\n\nEl Salvador: RP 2.9 A (both)\n\nPrimera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 5.0, LT1 = 5.0, LT2 = 5.0\nPostrera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 5.0, LT1 = 5.0\nSeasonal RPs: primera = 3.9, postrera = 3.9, annual = 2.9\nImpact F1 = 0.529 | ERA5 tolerant F1 = 0.737 | Avg F1 = 0.633 | CV = 0.000\n\nEl Salvador has fewer EM-DAT impact years, making impact F1 a more informative discriminator. The max avg F1 option provides the best balance between capturing impact events and predicting rainfall anomalies. Prioritizing ERA5 skill alone would sacrifice impact detection without sufficient gain in rainfall accuracy to justify the tradeoff.\nGuatemala: RP 2.7 A (both)\n\nPrimera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 5.8, LT2 = 5.8\nPostrera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 4.4\nSeasonal RPs: primera = 3.5, postrera = 3.9, annual = 2.7\nImpact F1 = 0.649 | ERA5 tolerant F1 = 0.667 | Avg F1 = 0.658 | CV = 0.079\n\nGuatemala (StartNetwork): RP 2.9 A (both)\n\nPrimera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 5.8, LT2 = 7.0\nPostrera thresholds (RP): LT0 = 4.4, LT1 = 5.8\nSeasonal RPs: primera = 4.4, postrera = 3.5, annual = 2.9\nImpact F1 = 0.721 | ERA5 tolerant F1 = 0.598 | Avg F1 = 0.660 | CV = 0.216",

    "text": "A.4 Archived: Exploring Larger Spatial Scales\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHistorical Context\n\n\n\nThis analysis was initiated early in the research process, following the binary classification metrics assessment. The hypothesis was that seasonal forecasts might perform better when aggregated over larger spatial scales than administrative boundaries. However, as the investigation progressed through continuous metrics, multi-source validation, and internal consistency diagnostics, the root cause of poor Postrera skill became clear: the INSIVUMEH forecasts themselves lack signal, regardless of spatial aggregation. This section is retained for completeness but was not pursued further.\n\n\nBoth SEAS5 and INSIVUMEH may perform poorly at the admin-1 (Chiquimula) scale because seasonal forecasts typically have better skill at larger spatial scales.
