## The Decision/Question

Which seasonal forecast should Guatemala's anticipatory action framework use for drought prediction in Chiquimula? Two options are available:

- **SEAS5**: ECMWF's global seasonal forecasting system
- **INSIVUMEH**: Regional forecasts from Guatemala's national meteorological service (CFSv2, CCSM4, and CESM1 models)

This book documents the reserch to answer this question for two agricultural seasons:

| Season | Months | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Primera** | May-August (MJJA) | First maize planting |
| **Postrera** | September-November (SON) | Second maize planting |

## Research Progression

### Step 1: Start with Standard Metrics

The analysis began with **binary classification metrics** (Chapter 1) - the traditional approach where forecasts are scored as hits or misses against a drought threshold (return period of 4 years).

**Primera results were encouraging**: SEAS5 showed F1 scores around 50-60%, significantly better than random guessing. Several model-leadtime combinations beat the 90th percentile of bootstrap random simulations.

**Postrera was troubling**: No model showed statistically significant skill. F1 scores hovered near random guessing levels. Different models won at different leadtimes with no clear pattern.

*Remaining question*: Are the Postrera results genuinely inconclusive, or are binary metrics too noisy with only ~6 drought events in 25 years?

### Step 2: Try Continuous Metrics

Chapter 2 introduced **continuous metrics** that don't require threshold choices: Spearman correlation, RMSE, and ROC-AUC. These provide partial credit for near-misses and are more stable with small samples.

**Primera confirmation**: SEAS5 dominated across all continuous metrics. AUC values around 0.88 - meaning 88% probability of correctly ranking a drought year below a non-drought year. The signal was real.

**Postrera remained ambiguous**: Different metrics favored different models:

- Spearman: SEAS5 best at LT1
- RMSE: CCSM4 best
- AUC: SEAS5 at LT1, CCSM4 at LT2

No model showed AUC consistently above 0.7 (general threshold for "acceptable" discrimination skill).

*Remaining question*: Are these results sensitive to which observation dataset we validate against? Would a different "ground truth" give the same answer?

### Step 3: Bring in a Third Opinion

Chapter 3 introduced **CHIRPS** as an independent observation source alongside ERA5 and ENACTS. If forecasts perform well against multiple observation sources, the skill assessment is more credible.

**Primera verdict**: Skill was robust across all three observation sources. SEAS5 won most comparisons.

**Postrera raised a red flag**: CCSM4 showed *better* skill at longer leadtimes (LT2-3) than shorter ones (LT1). This is backwards - forecast skill should degrade with increasing leadtime, not improve. The pattern suggested we might be seeing noise rather than genuine skill.

*Remaining question*: What's causing the inverted skill-leadtime relationship for Postrera?

### Step 4: Check for Drift

Chapter 4 investigated whether **temporal trends** in forecasts or observations could explain the strange patterns.

**Findings**:

- ENACTS showed a drying trend for Primera, but other sources showed similar patterns
- Forecast error drift was modest (~5-8 mm/year)
- **Split-half stability** was the key finding: Primera correlations were stable between 2000-2012 and 2013-2024, but Postrera correlations were wildly different between periods

The drift analysis didn't explain the inverted skill pattern.

### Step 5: The Decider - Forecast Internal Consistency

Chapter 5 applied **internal consistency diagnostics** - asking not "do forecasts predict observations?" but "do forecasts behave like forecasts?"

**Inter-leadtime correlations**: For a well-behaved forecast, LT1 and LT2 predictions for the same target season should correlate - they're trying to predict the same thing.

- SEAS5: LT1-LT2 correlations of 0.6-0.9 (expected)
- INSIVUMEH Primera: Moderate correlations of 0.3-0.7 (acceptable)
- INSIVUMEH Postrera: **Near-zero or negative correlations** - when LT1 predicts wet, LT2 might predict dry for the same season

**Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Forecasts should show interannual variability approaching observed variability.

- Observed Postrera CV: ~23%
- SEAS5 Postrera CV: ~15% (reasonable)
- INSIVUMEH Postrera CV: **3-7%** - forecasts barely varied from climatology

This explained everything. INSIVUMEH Postrera forecasts weren't failing skill tests because Postrera is hard to predict - they were failing because **the forecasts show much less interannual variability than the observed rainfall**. The apparent skill differences between leadtimes were artifacts of forecasts that vary little from year to year.

## Final Recommendations

| Season | Recommended | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Primera | **SEAS5** | High | Clear skill advantage across all metrics and observation sources |
| Postrera | **SEAS5** | Low | SEAS5 shows better internal consistency, though skill and consistency remains limited for all models |

### The Postrera Problem

For Postrera, the recommendation is SEAS5 by elimination rather than demonstrated skill. INSIVUMEH Postrera forecasts show **much lower interannual variability than observed rainfall** and weak consistency between leadtimes—suggesting limited predictive signal for this season.

SEAS5 at least *behaves* like a forecast: different leadtimes agree with each other, and it shows realistic interannual variability. Whether this translates to operational skill for Postrera remains uncertain.

**Operational implications for Postrera**:
- Consider monitoring-based triggers (observed rainfall deficits, VHI) rather than relying solely on seasonal forecasts
- Acknowledge limited predictability in operational communications
- Supplementing forecast-based triggers with monitoring-based indicators (e.g., observed rainfall deficits or VHI during early Postrera)

## Book Structure

The chapters document each step of this journey:

| Step | Question | Finding |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1. Binary Metrics | Do forecasts beat random guessing? | Primera yes (SEAS5 wins), Postrera inconclusive |
| 2. Continuous Metrics | Does skill hold with different metrics? | Primera confirmed (SEAS5 wins), Postrera ambiguous |
| 3. CHIRPS Tie-Breaker | Is skill robust across observation sources? | Primera robust, Postrera still ambiguous |
| 4. Temporal Drift | Are trends/drift affecting skill estimates? | Mild drift, unlikely to explain poor Postrera skill |
| 5. Internal Consistency | Are forecasts internally coherent? | INSIVUMEH Postrera forecasts lack signal |
