# Key Findings {.unnumbered}

This book evaluates seasonal precipitation forecasts for drought prediction in **Chiquimula, Guatemala**. We compare SEAS5 (ECMWF global) against INSIVUMEH (Guatemala national service) for two agricultural seasons: Primera (May-Aug) and Postrera (Sep-Nov).

## Decision Steps

| Step | Question | Finding |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1. Binary Metrics | Do forecasts beat random guessing? | Primera yes (SEAS5 wins), Postrera inconclusive |
| 2. Continuous Metrics | Does skill hold with different metrics? | Primera confirmed (SEAS5 wins), Postrera ambiguous |
| 3. CHIRPS Tie-Breaker | Is skill robust across observation sources? Does a 3rd data source clear Postrera ambiguity?| Primera robust, Postrera still ambiguous  |
| 4. Temporal Drift | Are trends/drift affecting skill estimates? | Mild drift, unlikely to be the significant factor causing poor postrera skill |
| 5. Internal Consistency | Are forecasts internally coherent? | INSIVUMEH Postrera forecasts completely internally incoherent - lack signal |

## Recommendations

| Season | Forecast | Confidence | Rationale |
|--------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Primera** | SEAS5 | High | Clear skill advantage across all metrics and observation sources |
| **Postrera** | SEAS5 | Low | All sources show low "skill." However, INSIVUMEH forecasts show no internal consistency and barely vary from climatology |

## Abstract

This evaluation informs forecast selection for anticipatory action triggers in Chiquimula, Guatemala (2026). We compared ECMWF SEAS5 and INSIVUMEH (CFSv2, CCSM4, CESM1) seasonal precipitation forecasts using 25 years (2000–2024) of hindcasts validated against three independent observation sources (ERA5, ENACTS, CHIRPS). For Primera (May–August), SEAS5 is recommended based on consistently stronger performance across both binary and continuous skill metrics (F1, ROC-AUC, Spearman correlation), with ROC-AUC values of 0.87–0.88 at 1–2 month lead times that remain robust across all observation sources. For Postrera (September–November), SEAS5 is recommended by elimination: INSIVUMEH forecasts exhibit near-zero inter-leadtime correlations (r = -0.1 to 0.2) and coefficient of variation 3–7% compared to 23% in observations, indicating negligible predictive signal. The counterintuitive pattern of higher apparent skill at longer lead times (LT3 > LT1) for INSIVUMEH Postrera is attributable to sampling noise. No model demonstrates reliable Postrera skill (AUC consistently above 0.7), suggesting monitoring-based triggers may be more appropriate than forecast-only approaches for this season.
