# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This book evaluates the skill of seasonal precipitation forecasts for detecting drought conditions in **Chiquimula, Guatemala** - a key region in the Central American Dry Corridor. We compare two forecast sources:

- **SEAS5**: ECMWF's global seasonal forecasting system
- **INSIVUMEH**: Regional forecasts from Guatemala's national meteorological service (using CFSv2, CCSM4, and CESM1 models)

## Agricultural Seasons

Guatemala's dry corridor has two main agricultural seasons:

| Season | Months | Typical Crops |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Primera** | May-August (MJJA) | First maize planting |
| **Postrera** | September-November (SON) | Second maize planting |

## Drought Definition

We define drought using a **return period of 4 years (RP4)**, meaning:

- Approximately 6 drought years expected over the 25-year baseline (2000-2024)
- Threshold calculated separately for each forecast model and observation source
- This aligns with typical anticipatory action trigger frameworks

## Comparison Frameworks

Throughout this analysis, we use two comparison frameworks:

1. **Native Comparison**: Each forecast validated against its typical observation source
   - SEAS5 vs ERA5 (global reanalysis)
   - INSIVUMEH vs ENACTS (station-blended satellite product)

2. **ENACTS-only Comparison**: All forecasts validated against ENACTS
   - Allows direct model-to-model comparison
   - ENACTS is the operational observation source for Guatemala

## Book Structure

**Chapter 1: Binary Classification Metrics**
Traditional skill assessment using F1 score, precision, recall. Treats forecasts as binary predictions: drought vs no-drought.

**Chapter 2: Continuous Metrics**
A more nuanced view using correlation, error magnitude, and ROC-AUC. Binary metrics can be noisy with small samples; continuous metrics provide additional perspective on forecast skill. ROC-AUC is particularly interpretable - it directly answers whether forecasts can discriminate drought from non-drought years.

## Key Questions

1. Which forecast source should be used for Primera? For Postrera?
2. At which leadtimes do forecasts show genuine skill?
3. Do forecasts beat random guessing?
4. When forecasts are wrong, how wrong are they?
