## Intro

The sole purpose of this doc is to inspect the ECMWF MARS data and make sure it is in the correct place.

This document will **either be deleted or expanded upon later** once the branch is merged with other branches where I have been working on additional forecast data (CDs ECMWF, INSUVIMEH forecast)

**Document not formatted for knitting**


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)
tar_load(gdf_aoi_adm)
tar_load(r_ecmwf_mars)
```

- The raster stack is `3528` bands 1 per month and leadtime.
- by plotting a random band we can see that the cells are in the right area over our AOI

```{r}
r <- unwrap(r_ecmwf_mars)
plot(r[[100]])
plot(gdf_aoi_adm$adm0$geometry,add= T)
```
