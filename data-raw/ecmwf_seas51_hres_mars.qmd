## Intro

- This notebook downloads the ECMWF SEAS 51 data from the MARS archive using the ECMWFAPI.
  + It downloads historical monthly ensemble data for the period 1981-2022. 
  + Each year is downloaded as 1 grib file.
- To run this notebook to download the data you will need to have your credential/authorization configured as in this [document](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/WEBAPI/Access+MARS)
- The data set accessed is not currently published, but we have access to it.
- The API request is based on the [ECMWF System 5 guide](https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/medialibrary/2017-10/System5_guide.pdf) request (p.34)
-I could only get it to work with the python libraries although theoretically it should be possible with the `{ecmwfr}` R package.
